        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Worldwide, the physiotherapy community is divided by name, with three different
          primary titles used: <strong>physiotherapy</strong>, <strong>physical therapy</strong>, and <strong>kinesiotherapy</strong>.
          Within the term physiotherapist, there are also language derivations such as <em>fisio</em>,
          <em>fisicos</em>, <em>fysio</em>, and <em>fiso</em>. Finding a single word to describe the community is challenging.

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Physiotherapy is a treatment that can ease pain and improve movement if you have an injury,
          illness, or disability. It uses exercise, manual therapy, massage, education, and advice to
          help patients restore, maintain, and make the most of their mobility and well-being.
